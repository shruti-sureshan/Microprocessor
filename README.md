# Microprocessor
In this Repository, I have implemented the basis of Assembly Language Programming

**List of Experiments:**
1a. Write an ALP to take two 8-bit BCD numbers as input from userand display sum as BCD.
1b. Write a MLP to calculate xy
2a. Write an ALP to take two 8-bit BCD numbers as input from user and display difference as BCD.
2b. Write a MLP to evaluate A = B * C / D 
3a. Write ALP to add two 16-bit BCD numbers given in program and store the 16-bit BCD result in a memory location.
3b. Write a far procedure to find the square of a number. Get the 2-digit BCD input from user, and display the BCD output on screen
4a. Write an ALP to subtract two 16-bit BCD numbers given in program and store the 16-bit BCD result in a memory location.
4b. Write an ALP to check the validity of a given password using CMPSB instruction. 
5a. Write an ALP to multiply two 16- bit BCD numbers given in program and store the hexadecimal result in a 32-bit memory location. 
5b. Write a MLP to evaluate (A + B) * (C â€“ D)
