# Microprocessor
In this Repository, I have implemented the basis of Assembly Language Programming<br/>

**List of Experiments:**<br/>
1a. Write an ALP to take two 8-bit BCD numbers as input from userand display sum as BCD.<br/>
1b. Write a MLP to calculate xy<br/>
2a. Write an ALP to take two 8-bit BCD numbers as input from user and display difference as BCD.<br/>
2b. Write a MLP to evaluate A = B * C / D <br/>
3a. Write ALP to add two 16-bit BCD numbers given in program and store the 16-bit BCD result in a memory location.<br/>
3b. Write a far procedure to find the square of a number. Get the 2-digit BCD input from user, and display the BCD output on screen<br/>
4a. Write an ALP to subtract two 16-bit BCD numbers given in program and store the 16-bit BCD result in a memory location.<br/>
4b. Write an ALP to check the validity of a given password using CMPSB instruction. <br/>
5a. Write an ALP to multiply two 16- bit BCD numbers given in program and store the hexadecimal result in a 32-bit memory location. <br/>
5b. Write a MLP to evaluate (A + B) * (C – D) <br/>
6a. Write an ALP to divide two 16-bit BCD numbers and store the hexadecimal quotient and remainder in two 16-bit memory locations. <br/>

7b. Write a MLP to display the area of a triangle taking b and h from user. <br/>
8a. Write an ALP to display N natural numbers in descending order.<br/>
8b. Write an ALP to copy a string to another using MOVSB instruction. <br/>
9a. Write an ALP to print Fibonacci series upto given N. <br/>
9b. Write an MLP to swap two numbers given in memory locations.<br/>
10a. Write an ALP to take two 8-bit BCD numbers as input and display the quotient and remainder as BCDs on screen. <br/>
10b. Write a MLP to compute the surface area of a given sphere.<br/>
11a. Write a C/Java/Python program to translate a given logical address to physical address using 80386DX address translation mechanism.<br/>
11b. Write an ALP to compare two strings given in program and print “same” or “different” on screen using CMPSB instruction. <br/>
12a. Write an ALP to display the maximum and minimum elements of an user given array of 10 numbers. <br/>
12b. Write a MLP to convert given temperature from Centigrate to Fahrenheit.<br/>
